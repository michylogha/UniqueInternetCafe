</h1>SERVICES</h1>
	

<p>
<h1>Network and/or Online Games</h1> – the most common service in an internet café which at present, constitute 60 to 70% of overall income of most cafés.
</h1>Internet Access</h1> – to be distinguished from online games which also need access to the Internet, this service includes surfing, chatting, emailing and the free voice over internet protocol service like skype and Yahoo Messenger voice chat.
Offline Rental – this service refers to what a customer would do in a computer that does not require Internet access like typing, programming and other similar activity.</h1>
<h1>Printing</h1> – the process of producing a hard copy of a document with texts and images either in black and white or in colors as the case may be.</h1>
<h1>Scanning </h1>– can be said to be the reverse of printing because this is the process of converting text and images from hard to soft copy.</h1>
<h1>Encoding</h1> – to differentiate form the offline rental where the customer do the job, encoding includes typing, spreadsheet processing and other things that an Internet café personnel do for a client. The service includes the printing of the job done by the café worker.
<h1>Photocopying</h1> – some may say that this service is not computer-related but I say there are now 3-in-1 printers where this job can be done. Technically, photocopying can be said to be scanning and printing which are well within the realm of computer services.
<h1>Online Loading</h1> – selling of prepaid loads for cellular phones and online games using the web service of another party (load distributor).</h1>
